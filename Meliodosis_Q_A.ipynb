GLANDERS AND MELIOIDOSIS HAVE BOTH BEEN STUDIED FOR WEAPONISATION IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES IN THE PAST. THEY PRODUCE SIMILAR CLINICAL SYNDROMES. THE SYMPTOMS DEPEND UPON THE ROUTE OF INFECTION BUT ONE FORM OF THE DISEASE MAY PROGRESS TO ANOTHER, OR THE DISEASE MIGHT RUN A CHRONIC RELAPSING COURSE. FOUR CLINICAL FORMS ARE GENERALLY DESCRIBED: LOCALISED INFECTION, PULMONARY INFECTION, SEPTICAEMIA AND CHRONIC SUPPURATIVE INFECTIONS OF THE SKIN. ALL TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD BE ADAPTED ACCORDING TO THE SUSCEPTIBILITY REPORTS FROM ANY ISOLATES OBTAINED.

HOWEVER, DELAYED DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT COULD LEAD TO FATALITY. TO IDENTIFY KNOWLEDGE OF CNS MELIOIDOSIS, WE SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW CASE REPORTS AND CASE SERIES. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: WE SEARCHED THROUGH PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE AND THAI-JOURNAL CITATION INDEX DATABASES AS WELL AS GOOGLE SCHOLAR WITH THE LAST DATE ON JULY 10, 2018. THE DIAGNOSIS OF CNS MELIOIDOSIS HAD TO BE CONFIRMED WITH CULTURE, SEROLOGY OR POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION. WE EXCLUDED THE ANIMAL CASES AND THE STUDIES THAT THE CLINICAL DATA WERE NOT AVAILABLE. WE IDENTIFIED 1170 RELEVANT STUDIES, WHILE 70 STUDIES WITH A TOTAL OF 120 PATIENTS WERE ANALYZED. NINETY-THREE PERCENT OF PATIENTS WERE REPORTED FROM THE ENDEMIC AREA OF MELIOIDOSIS. MEDIAN AGE WAS 40 YEARS (IQR 18-53), AND 70% WERE MEN. A TOTAL OF 60% HAD ONE OR MORE RISK FACTORS FOR MELIOIDOSIS. THE MEDIAN DURATION FROM CLINICAL ONSET TO DIAGNOSIS WAS TEN DAYS (IQR 5-25). FEVER (82%), HEADACHE (54%), UNILATERAL WEAKNESS (57%) AND CRANIAL NERVE DEFICITS (52%) ARE AMONG THE PROMINENT PRESENTATION. MOST PATIENT (67%) HAD AT LEAST ONE EXTRANEUROLOGICAL ORGAN INVOLVEMENT. THE CSF PROFILE MOSTLY SHOWED MONONUCLEAR PLEOCYTOSIS (64%), HIGH PROTEIN (93%) AND NORMAL GLUCOSE (66%). THE RIM-ENHANCING PATTERN (78%) IS THE MOST FREQUENT NEUROIMAGING FINDING IN ENCEPHALOMYELITIS AND BRAIN ABSCESS PATIENTS. BOTH BRAINSTEM (34%) AND FRONTAL LOBE (34%) ARE THE MOST AFFECTED LOCATIONS. MORTALITY RATE WAS 20%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: THIS STUDY IS THE MOST EXTENSIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF CASE REPORTS AND CASE SERIES OF CNS MELIOIDOSIS IN ALL AGE GROUPS. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS SHOULD BE CAUTIOUSLY INTERPRETED DUE TO THE MISSING DATA ISSUE. THE PROPENSITY OF BRAINSTEM INVOLVEMENT WHICH CORRELATES WITH PROMINENT CRANIAL NERVE DEFICITS IS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF CNS MELIOIDOSIS ESPECIALLY ENCEPHALOMYELITIS TYPE. THE PRESENTING FEATURES OF FEVER AND NEUROLOGICAL DEFICITS (ESPECIALLY CRANIAL NERVE PALSIES) ALONG WITH THE MONONUCLEAR CSF PLEOCYTOSIS IN A PATIENT WHO LIVES IN THE ENDEMIC AREA AND ALSO HAS THE RISK FACTOR FOR MELIOIDOSIS SHOULD RAISE THE CNS MELIOIDOSIS AS THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS.                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n","THE POPULATION OF THE TOP END OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY HAS A HIGH INCIDENCE OF SEVERAL INFECTIONS OF PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE IN THE IMMUNOSUPPRESSED.

DIAGNOSIS OF MELIOIDOSIS IS OFTEN DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE PROTEAN CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF THE DISEASE, AND IT MAY MIMIC OTHER DISEASES, SUCH AS TUBERCULOSIS. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT STRAINS OF B. PSEUDOMALLEI THAT HAVE BEEN ISOLATED FROM PATIENTS WITH MELIOIDOSIS, BUT IT WAS NOT CLEAR IF THEY COULD CAUSE A SIMILAR DISEASE IN A CHRONIC BALB/C MURINE MODEL OF MELIOIDOSIS. HENCE, WE WANTED TO EXAMINE CHRONICALLY INFECTED MICE EXPOSED TO DIFFERENT STRAINS OF B. PSEUDOMALLEI TO DETERMINE IF THERE WERE DIFFERENCES IN THE HOST IMMUNE RESPONSE TO THE PATHOGEN. RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED COMMON HOST IMMUNE RESPONSES EXHIBITED IN CHRONICALLY INFECTED BALB/C MICE, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS SOME HETEROGENEITY IN THE HOST RESPONSE IN CHRONICALLY INFECTED MICE AFTER EXPOSURE TO DIFFERENT STRAINS OF B. PSEUDOMALLEI. THEY ALL DISPLAYED PYOGRANULOMATOUS LESIONS IN THEIR SPLEENS WITH A LARGE INFLUX OF MONOCYTES/MACROPHAGES, NK CELLS, AND NEUTROPHILS IDENTIFIED BY FLOW CYTOMETRY. SERA FROM CHRONICALLY INFECTED MICE BY ELISA EXHIBITED ELEVATED IGG TITERS TO THE PATHOGEN, AND WE DETECTED BY LUMINEX MICRO-BEAD ARRAY TECHNOLOGY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE EXPRESSION OF INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES/CHEMOKINES, SUCH AS IFN-, IL-1, IL-1, KC, AND MIG. BY IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL AND IN SITU RNA HYBRIDIZATION ANALYSIS WE FOUND THAT THE INCREASED EXPRESSION OF PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES (IL-1, IL-1, TNF-, IFN-) WAS CONFINED PRIMARILY TO THE AREA WITH THE PATHOGEN WITHIN PYOGRANULOMATOUS LESIONS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT CULTURED SPLENOCYTES FROM CHRONICALLY INFECTED MICE COULD EXPRESS IFN-, TNF-, AND MIP-1 EX VIVO WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL EXOGENOUS STIMULATION. IN ADDITION BY FLOW CYTOMETRY, WE DETECTED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF INTRACELLULAR EXPRESSION OF TNF- AND IFN- WITHOUT A PROTEIN TRANSPORT BLOCKER IN MONOCYTES/MACROPHAGES, NK CELLS, AND NEUTROPHILS BUT NOT IN CD4(+) OR CD8(+) T CELLS IN SPLENOCYTES FROM CHRONICALLY INFECTED MICE. CONCLUSION: TAKEN TOGETHER THE COMMON FEATURES WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IN CHRONICALLY INFECTED MICE WHEN 10 DIFFERENT HUMAN CLINICAL STRAINS OF B. PSEUDOMALLEI WERE EXAMINED COULD SERVE AS BIOMARKERS WHEN EVALUATING POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC AGENTS IN MICE FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC MELIOIDOSIS IN HUMANS.    1\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ..\n","BURKHOLDERIA PSEUDOMALLEI IS AN AGENT OF MELIOIDOSIS AND IS CLOSELY RELATED TO AVIRULENT B.

THE DIFFERENCE IN THE FLIC GENE MIGHT BE RELATED TO VIRULENCE. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, THE INVASION, INTERNALIZATION AND INTRACELLULAR REPLICATION OF BOTH PHAGOCYTIC (MOUSE MACROPHAGE CELL LINE RAW264.7) AND NON-PHAGOCYTIC CELLS (HUMAN LUNG EPITHELIAL CELL LINE A549) OF B. PSEUDOMALLEI FLIC KNOCKOUT MUTANT (MM35) COMPLEMENTED WITH ITS OWN FLIC (CP) OR WITH B. THAILANDENSIS FLIC (CT) WAS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE WILD-TYPE STRAINS OF B. PSEUDOMALLEI (1026B) AND B. THAILANDENSIS (E257). IN PHAGOCYTIC CELLS, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN BACTERIAL UPTAKE BETWEEN CP AND CT, BUT MM35 WAS INTERNALIZED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS COMPARED WITH 1026B, CP, CT AND E257. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT FLAGELLA ARE INVOLVED IN MACROPHAGE INVASION. IN NON-PHAGOCYTIC CELLS, CP AND CT SHOWED SIMILAR INVASIVE CAPACITIES WHILE 1026B, CP AND CT SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INVASIVENESS THAN MM35, SUGGESTING THAT FLAGELLA FACILITATE THE NON-PHAGOCYTIC CELL INVASION. HOWEVER, THE INVASIVE CAPACITY OF MM35 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF E257, SUGGESTING THAT IN ADDITION TO THE FLAGELLA, B.

HERE, WE REPORT A CASE OF B PSEUDOMALLEI INFECTION PRESENTING WITH A LUNG ABSCESS AND OSTEOMYELITIS IN AN ADULT MAN. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 38-YEAR-OLD MAN PRESENTED WITH HIGH-GRADE FEVER, PRODUCTIVE COUGH, AND CHRONIC JOINT PAIN OF THE LIMBS. EXAMINATIONS REVEALED MULTIPLE NODULES, SOFT TISSUE MASS SHADOWS, PULMONARY CAVITATION IN BILATERAL LUNGS, AND FLUID AND SOFT TISSUE SWELLING IN BILATERAL HIPS. DIAGNOSES: THE MICROBIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS BASED ON A POSITIVE CULTURE REVEALED THE ETIOLOGIC AGENT TO BE B PSEUDOMALLEI. INTERVENTIONS: THE PATIENT WAS TREATED WITH INTRAVENOUS CEFTAZIDIME AND LEVOFLOXACIN, AND OUT-OF-HOSPITAL TREATMENT CONTINUED WITH ORAL COTRIMOXAZOLE. OUTCOMES: THE PATIENT RESPONDED WELL TO THE TREATMENT. LESSONS: SUBSECTIONS BECAUSE OF ITS INCREASING INCIDENCE, B PSEUDOMALLEI INFECTION SHOULD BE HIGHLY SUSPECTED AMONG EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN LABORATORIES AND HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. MISDIAGNOSIS CAN LEAD TO TREATMENT FAILURE AND HIGH MORTALITY RATES, ESPECIALLY AMONG INDIVIDUALS WORKING IN LABORATORIES IN NON-ENDEMIC AREAS; THEREFORE, EARLY AND ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS OF B PSEUDOMALLEI INFECTION IS ESSENTIAL.

SEPTICEMIA IS THE MOST COMMON PRESENTATION OF THE DISEASE WITH A 40% MORTALITY RATE EVEN WITH APPROPRIATE TREATMENTS. BETTER DIAGNOSTIC TESTS ARE THEREFORE NEEDED TO IMPROVE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY AND SURVIVAL RATES. RESULTS: WE HAVE USED MICROARRAY TECHNOLOGY TO GENERATE GENOME-WIDE TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILES (>48,000 TRANSCRIPTS) FROM THE WHOLE BLOOD OF PATIENTS WITH SEPTICEMIC MELIOIDOSIS (N = 32), PATIENTS WITH SEPSIS CAUSED BY OTHER PATHOGENS (N = 31), AND UNINFECTED CONTROLS (N = 29). UNSUPERVISED ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED THE EXISTENCE OF A WHOLE BLOOD TRANSCRIPTIONAL SIGNATURE DISTINGUISHING PATIENTS WITH SEPSIS FROM CONTROL SUBJECTS. THE MAJORITY OF CHANGES OBSERVED WERE COMMON TO BOTH SEPTICEMIC MELIOIDOSIS AND SEPSIS CAUSED BY OTHER INFECTIONS, INCLUDING GENES RELATED TO INFLAMMATION, INTERFERON-RELATED GENES, NEUTROPHILS, CYTOTOXIC CELLS, AND T-CELLS. FINALLY, CLASS PREDICTION ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED A 37 TRANSCRIPT CANDIDATE DIAGNOSTIC SIGNATURE THAT DISTINGUISHED MELIOIDOSIS FROM SEPSIS CAUSED BY OTHER ORGANISMS WITH 100% ACCURACY IN A TRAINING SET. THIS FINDING WAS CONFIRMED IN 2 INDEPENDENT VALIDATION SETS, WHICH GAVE HIGH PREDICTION ACCURACIES OF 78% AND 80%, RESPECTIVELY. THIS SIGNATURE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ENRICHED IN GENES CODING FOR PRODUCTS INVOLVED IN THE MHC CLASS II ANTIGEN PROCESSING AND PRESENTATION PATHWAY. CONCLUSIONS: BLOOD TRANSCRIPTIONAL PATTERNS DISTINGUISH PATIENTS WITH SEPTICEMIC MELIOIDOSIS FROM PATIENTS WITH SEPSIS CAUSED BY OTHER PATHOGENS. ONCE CONFIRMED IN A LARGE SCALE TRIAL THIS DIAGNOSTIC SIGNATURE MIGHT CONSTITUTE THE BASIS OF A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSTIC ASSAY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n","Name: AB, Length: 2606, dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T03:38:54.667909Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T03:38:54.668185Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T03:38:54.676255Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T03:38:54.668156Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T03:38:54.674977Z"},"trusted":true,"id":"A6euVKkpB_Q8","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1637805690490,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":412,"user":{"displayName":"THITAREE KHEMANANTAKUL","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"18300780279483829503"}},"outputId":"cc28266d-3131-4e55-de45-e0627dd63b68"},"source":["print(\"Abstract example\",\"\\n\")\n","print(df.AB.values[2])\n","print(df.AU.values[2])\n","print(df.AU_UN.values[2])\n","print(df.DE.values[2])\n","print(df.DT.values[2])"],"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Abstract example \n","\n","MELIOIDOSIS IS AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE CAUSED BY BURKHOLDERIA PSEUDOMALLEI, MOSTLY AFFECTING PATIENTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND NORTHERN AUSTRALIA.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF MELIOIDOSIS RANGE FROM FULMINANT SEPTICEMIC ILLNESS TO AN INDOLENT LOCAL INFECTION. THE DISEASE OFTEN INVOLVES MULTIPLE ORGANS, INCLUDING THE LUNG, SPLEEN, LIVER, AND OTHER VISCERAL ORGANS. MUSCULOSKELETAL INFECTION IS USUALLY SEEN AS A PART OF MULTIORGAN INVOLVEMENT, BUT LOCALIZED MUSCULOSKELETAL INVOLVEMENT MAY OCCUR. THE MOST COMMON MANIFESTATION OF MUSCULOSKELETAL MELIOIDOSIS IS SEPTIC ARTHRITIS, FOLLOWED BY OSTEOMYELITIS, PYOMYOSITIS, AND SOFT TISSUE ABSCESSES. THE CLINICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF MUSCULOSKELETAL MELIOIDOSIS ARE NONSPECIFIC, AND THE DIAGNOSIS NEEDS A HIGH LEVEL OF SUSPICION. ASSOCIATED INFECTION OF LUNGS AND VISCERAL ORGANS IS SUGGESTIVE OF MELIOIDOSIS. THE DISEASE REQUIRES SPECIAL LABORATORY FACILITIES AND TREATMENT. INAPPROPRIATE OR INADEQUATE TREATMENT LEADS TO HIGH MORTALITY RATE OR LONG-TERM RELAPSE OF THE DISEASE.

RECENT MODELING AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE WIDESPREAD PRESENCE OF B. PSEUDOMALLEI IN OTHERWISE UNRECOGNIZED REGIONS WITH A PREDICTED MORTALITY OF 90,000 DEATHS WORLDWIDE. INNOVATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES ARE ALSO UNCOVERING HOW HYDRODYNAMIC, PEDOLOGY, FAUNA, AND WEATHER EVENTS INFLUENCE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND INCIDENCE OF MELIOIDOSIS CASES. OF CONCERN IS THE CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL WARMING, WHICH WILL BE CONDUCIVE TO B. PSEUDOMALLEI IN COMBINATION WITH THE GLOBAL DIABETES PANDEMIC. IN FACT, OVER 80% OF PATIENT DEVELOPING MELIOIDOSIS HAVE UNDERLYING COMORBIDITIES. FOR THIS GREAT MIMICKER, CULTURE REMAINS THE MAINSTAY OF DIAGNOSIS AND DESPITE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER ASSAYS, CHALLENGES STILL REMAIN IN REDUCING TIME TO DIAGNOSIS AND AVOIDING MISDIAGNOSIS. WITH INSTITUTION OF TIMELY ANTIMICROBIALS SUCH AS CEFTAZIDIME AND SUPPORTIVE INTENSIVE CARE, OVERALL MORTALITY CAN BE REDUCED TO 10%, ALTHOUGH THIS CAN STILL BE AS HIGH AS 50% IN POORLY RESOURCED AREAS. PROMISE IS ON THE HORIZON WITH THE FIRST HUMAN VACCINE TRIALS BEING PLANNED FOR 2021. MEANWHILE NEW MULTIOMICS TECHNIQUES ARE GIVING US A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF VIRULENCE AND HOST-PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS ON PATIENT OUTCOMES.'\n"," 'MELIOIDOSIS IS AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE CAUSED BY BURKHOLDERIA PSEUDOMALLEI, MOSTLY AFFECTING PATIENTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND NORTHERN AUSTRALIA. THE DISEASE HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AROUND THE WORLD DUE TO THE INCREASED LEVELS OF TRAVEL AND POPULATION MOVEMENT. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF MELIOIDOSIS RANGE FROM FULMINANT SEPTICEMIC ILLNESS TO AN INDOLENT LOCAL INFECTION. THE DISEASE OFTEN INVOLVES MULTIPLE ORGANS, INCLUDING THE LUNG, SPLEEN, LIVER, AND OTHER VISCERAL ORGANS. MUSCULOSKELETAL INFECTION IS USUALLY SEEN AS A PART OF MULTIORGAN INVOLVEMENT, BUT LOCALIZED MUSCULOSKELETAL INVOLVEMENT MAY OCCUR. THE MOST COMMON MANIFESTATION OF MUSCULOSKELETAL MELIOIDOSIS IS SEPTIC ARTHRITIS, FOLLOWED BY OSTEOMYELITIS, PYOMYOSITIS, AND SOFT TISSUE ABSCESSES. THE CLINICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF MUSCULOSKELETAL MELIOIDOSIS ARE NONSPECIFIC, AND THE DIAGNOSIS NEEDS A HIGH LEVEL OF SUSPICION. ASSOCIATED INFECTION OF LUNGS AND VISCERAL ORGANS IS SUGGESTIVE OF MELIOIDOSIS. THE DISEASE REQUIRES SPECIAL LABORATORY FACILITIES AND TREATMENT. INAPPROPRIATE OR INADEQUATE TREATMENT LEADS TO HIGH MORTALITY RATE OR LONG-TERM RELAPSE OF THE DISEASE. THE CAUSATIVE ORGANISM OF MELIOIDOSIS, CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS, AND IMAGING FEATURES OF MUSCULOSKELETAL MELIOIDOSIS ARE REVIEWED.'\n"," ... nan nan nan]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dp856L02HOSN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1637805694475,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":556,"user":{"displayName":"THITAREE KHEMANANTAKUL","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"18300780279483829503"}}},"source":["## Remove punctuation from each text:\n","def lower_case(input_str):\n","    input_str = input_str.lower()\n","    return input_str\n","\n","df['TI'] = df['TI'].apply(lambda x: re.sub('[^a-zA-z0-9\\s]','',x))\n","df['TI'] = df['TI'].apply(lambda x: lower_case(x))\n","\n","df['AB'] = df['AB'].apply(str)\n","df['AB'] = df['AB'].apply(lambda x: re.sub('[^a-zA-z0-9\\s]','',x))\n","df['AB'] = df['AB'].apply(lambda x: lower_case(x))"],"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"UZxyKs5TICS8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1637805696034,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"THITAREE KHEMANANTAKUL","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"18300780279483829503"}},"outputId":"b123a41f-82f3-4f84-e615-7f07a4818ae2"},"source":["df['AB'].head()"],"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0    background endemic to soils of northern austra...\n","1    melioidosis caused by the facultative intracel...\n","2    melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by...\n","3    melioidosis is a tropical bacterial infection ...\n","4    melioidosis which is infection with the gramne...\n","Name: AB, dtype: object"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"se1zWGQCKGzs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1637805696576,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"THITAREE KHEMANANTAKUL","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"18300780279483829503"}},"outputId":"a1205ced-7ee4-495b-b1fa-155d5a909839"},"source":["text = df[[\"TI\"]]\n","text.head()"],"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>TI</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>melioidosis an updated review</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>melioidosis a neglected cause of communityacqu...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>musculoskeletal melioidosis</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>a review of melioidosis cases imported into eu...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>melioidosis</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                                                  TI\n","0                      melioidosis an updated review\n","1  melioidosis a neglected cause of communityacqu...\n","2                        musculoskeletal melioidosis\n","3  a review of melioidosis cases imported into eu...\n","4                                        melioidosis"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"GJ3izi9Ih1Am","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1637805696903,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"THITAREE KHEMANANTAKUL","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"18300780279483829503"}},"outputId":"4206941b-7ce1-45f7-e5d7-ba1493f2d528"},"source":["## IPython Utilities\n","from IPython.display import HTML\n","\n","import notebook as widgets\n","from ipywidgets import interact, interactive, fixed, interact_manual, interactive_output, VBox\n","\n","from IPython.html import widgets\n","from IPython.display import display, Image, HTML, Markdown, clear_output\n","\n","def printmd(string):\n","    display(Markdown(string))"],"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/IPython/html.py:14: ShimWarning: The `IPython.html` package has been deprecated since IPython 4.0.
