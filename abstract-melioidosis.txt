BACKGROUND: Endemic to soils of Northern Australia, Burkholderia pseudomallei is 
the Gram-negative pathogen responsible for melioidosis, which causes a clinical 
spectrum ranging from pneumonia and/or cutaneous infection to disseminated 
disease with fulminant septicaemia. Incident cases peak after monsoonal rains, 
particularly in individuals with immune dysfunction. Early diagnosis of 
melioidosis is challenging for clinicians, given its ability to mimic many other 
diseases and high clinical (associated mortality) impact.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to provide general practitioners with an 
overview of melioidosis, covering epidemiology, risk factors for infection, 
clinical disease spectrum, diagnostic techniques and an approach to management, 
including public health aspects.
DISCUSSION: Primary care physicians play a key role in early disease 
recognition, initial patient stabilisation, request of appropriate clinical 
samples (particularly blood cultures) and prompt commencement of efficacious 
antibiotics. Patient education is paramount during high-risk periods, chiefly 
for patients with diabetes and/or those who engage in hazardous alcohol use, 
living in endemic areas of Australia.

Melioidosis, caused by the facultative intracellular gram-negative pathogen 
Burkholderia pseudomallei, is an emerging cause of community-acquired pneumonia 
across the tropics. The majority of patients present with pneumonia with or 
without sepsis, but localized and asymptomatic infection is also well 
recognized. Recent modeling and epidemiological studies have demonstrated the 
widespread presence of B. pseudomallei in otherwise unrecognized regions with a 
predicted mortality of 90,000 deaths worldwide. Innovative environmental studies 
are also uncovering how hydrodynamic, pedology, fauna, and weather events 
influence geographic distribution and incidence of melioidosis cases. Of concern 
is the changes associated with global warming, which will be conducive to B. 
pseudomallei in combination with the global diabetes pandemic. In fact, over 80% 
of patient developing melioidosis have underlying comorbidities. For this great 
mimicker, culture remains the mainstay of diagnosis and despite availability of 
other assays, challenges still remain in reducing time to diagnosis and avoiding 
misdiagnosis. With institution of timely antimicrobials such as ceftazidime and 
supportive intensive care, overall mortality can be reduced to 10%, although 
this can still be as high as 50% in poorly resourced areas. Promise is on the 
horizon with the first human vaccine trials being planned for 2021. Meanwhile 
new multiomics techniques are giving us a better understanding of the role of 
virulence and host-pathogen interactions on patient outcomes.

Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, mostly 
affecting patients in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. The disease has 
been increasingly recognized around the world due to the increased levels of 
travel and population movement. Clinical manifestations of melioidosis range 
from fulminant septicemic illness to an indolent local infection. The disease 
often involves multiple organs, including the lung, spleen, liver, and other 
visceral organs. Musculoskeletal infection is usually seen as a part of 
multiorgan involvement, but localized musculoskeletal involvement may occur. The 
most common manifestation of musculoskeletal melioidosis is septic arthritis, 
followed by osteomyelitis, pyomyositis, and soft tissue abscesses. The clinical 
and radiological manifestations of musculoskeletal melioidosis are nonspecific, 
and the diagnosis needs a high level of suspicion. Associated infection of lungs 
and visceral organs is suggestive of melioidosis. The disease requires special 
laboratory facilities and treatment. Inappropriate or inadequate treatment leads 
to high mortality rate or long-term relapse of the disease. The causative 
organism of melioidosis, clinical manifestations, and imaging features of 
musculoskeletal melioidosis are reviewed.

Melioidosis is a tropical bacterial infection, rarely encountered, and poorly 
known by clinicians. In non-endemic areas, a misdiagnosis can lead to a fatal 
outcome. This study aims to identify the main characteristics of imported and 
diagnosed melioidosis cases in Europe to increase clinician's awareness of this 
diagnosis. A literature review of imported and diagnosed human melioidosis cases 
in Europe was performed. PubMed and Web of Science search engines were used for 
retrieving articles from 2000 to November 2018. Seventy-seven cases of imported 
melioidosis into Europe described in the literature were identified. More than 
half of the cases were acquired in Thailand (53%) by men (73%). Patients were 
usually exposed to Burkholderia pseudomallei during a holiday stay (58%) of less 
than 1 month (23%) and were hospitalized during the month following their return 
to Europe (58%). Among travelers, melioidosis is less often associated with risk 
factor (16%), diabetes being the most frequently comorbidity related (19%). The 
clinical presentation was multifaceted, pneumonia being the most common symptom 
(52%), followed by cardiovascular form (45%) and skin and soft tissues damages 
(35%). The diagnosis was obtained by culture (92%), often supplemented by 
morphological, biochemical, and molecular identification (23%). Misdiagnoses 
were common (21%). Over half of the patients received a complete and adapted 
treatment (56%). Mortality is lower for returning traveler (6%). Imported 
melioidosis cases into Europe have their own characteristics. This possibility 
should be considered in patients with pneumonia, fever, and/or abscess returning 
from endemic areas even years after.

Melioidosis, which is infection with the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia 
pseudomallei, is an important cause of sepsis in east Asia and northern 
Australia. In northeastern Thailand, melioidosis accounts for 20% of all 
community-acquired septicaemias, and causes death in 40% of treated patients. B 
pseudomallei is an environmental saprophyte found in wet soils. It mostly 
infects adults with an underlying predisposing condition, mainly diabetes 
mellitus. Melioidosis is characterised by formation of abscesses, especially in 
the lungs, liver, spleen, skeletal muscle, and prostate. In a third of 
paediatric cases in southeast Asia, the disease presents as parotid abscess. In 
northern Australia, 4% of patients present with brain stem encephalitis. 
Ceftazidime is the treatment of choice for severe melioidosis, but response to 
high dose parenteral treatment is slow (median time to abatement of fever 9 
days). Maintenance antibiotic treatment is with a four-drug regimen of 
chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or with 
amoxicillin-clavulanate in children and pregnant women. However, even with 20 
weeks' antibiotic treatment, 10% of patients relapse. With improvements in 
health care and diagnostic microbiology in endemic areas of Asia, and increased 
travel, melioidosis will probably be recognised increasingly during the next 
decade.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Melioidosis is increasingly recognized around the world. 
Despite several decades of clinical research, the mortality rate for melioidosis 
remains high. This review focuses on studies that relate to patient management, 
including risk factors, diagnosis, treatment and prediction of the outcome. A 
brief summary of studies relating to genomics and genotyping, immunology and 
pathogenesis is provided.
RECENT FINDINGS: Involvement in the tsunami of December 2004 is a risk factor 
for melioidosis, and risk may extend to individuals who were uninjured 
bystanders. Several standard microbiological techniques used to culture and 
identify Burkholderia pseudomallei have been evaluated. Polymerase chain 
reaction has been developed for bacterial identification, although limited 
evaluation has been performed in the clinical setting. Two trials of 
antimicrobial therapy provide evidence with which to refine existing treatment 
protocols. Inexpensive clinical and laboratory predictors for poor outcome have 
been described. Several putative vaccine candidates have been proposed and 
studied in animals, but no vaccine is on the immediate horizon.
SUMMARY: None of the studies reviewed here report strategies that reduce 
mortality. A key area for future research is the identification of affordable 
interventions that lower the death rate, and are applicable to low-resource 
settings.

Melioidosis is an emerging zoonosis, due to Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is 
a highly invasive, resistant, and resilient soil bacteria, transmitted by 
cutaneous or airborne route, and is a potential weapon for bioterrorism. 
Although the agent has been identified all over the world, the human disease is 
endemic only in SE Asia and Northern Australia, and gained recent interest after 
the December 2004 tsunami. Human infection can be a very severe systemic disease 
(mortality 20 to 80%), with protean expression, but the lung is the most 
affected organ (50%). Pathophysiology remains unclear. Diabetes mellitus is a 
major risk factor, and is present in half the Asian patients with melioidosis. 
Recommended antibiotic regimens are expensive, and in severe disease should be 
prolonged to 20 weeks to reduce the risk of relapse. Prospects for prevention 
are limited, and no vaccine is available yet.
